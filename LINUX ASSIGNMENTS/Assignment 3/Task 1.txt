Step 1: Fork an Existing Repository

* Go to the original repository you want to fork (you can simulate this by imagining a public repository on a platform like GitHub).
* Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository's page.
* This action will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository Locally

git clone <url_of_your_forked_repository>
cd <repository_name>


Step 3: Manage Updates from the Original Repository

# Add the original repository as a remote
git remote add upstream <url_of_original_repository>

# Fetch updates from the original repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge the updates into your local main branch
git merge upstream/main


Step 4: Make Changes and Commit

Make changes to the code locally, stage them, and commit them to your local repository.

# Make changes to the code

# Add changes to staging area
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"


Step 5: Push Changes to Your Forked Repository

git push origin main


Step 6: Create a Pull Request to the Original Repository

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click on the "New pull request" button.
4. Select the original repository as the base repository and your forked repository as the head repository.
5. Review the changes and create the pull request.

Step 7: Outline a Simple Code Review Process

* Review Pull Request: The original repository owner or a designated reviewer should review the pull request to ensure that the changes are in line with project requirements and coding standards.

* Provide Feedback: If necessary, provide feedback on the pull request, suggesting improvements or pointing out any issues.

* Address Feedback: The contributor should address any feedback provided by making necessary changes to the code.

* Approve and Merge: Once the changes are satisfactory, the pull request can be approved and merged into the original repository.
