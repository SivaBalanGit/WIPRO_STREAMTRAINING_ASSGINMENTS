Assignment 1: 

SDLC Overview - Create a one-page infographic that outlines the SDLC phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment), highlighting the importance of each phase and how they interconnect.

Introduction
Definition: The SDLC is a structured process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It ensures that the final product meets customer expectations and is delivered on time and within budget.

Phases of SDLC
1. Requirements

Purpose: Gather and analyze business requirements.
Activities: Meetings with stakeholders, documentation of needs, feasibility analysis.
Importance: Ensures the project starts with a clear understanding of what is needed, reducing the risk of missing critical requirements.

2. Design

Purpose: Plan the architecture and design of the system.
Activities: Creation of design documents, system architecture, data models, and interface designs.
Importance: Provides a blueprint for developers, ensuring all components integrate smoothly.

3. Implementation

Purpose: Develop the actual software code.
Activities: Writing code, code reviews, version control management.
Importance: Turns design documents into a functional software application.
Visual Element: Icon of a computer or coding symbols.

4. Testing

Purpose: Verify that the software works as intended.
Activities: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).
Importance: Identifies and resolves defects, ensuring software quality and performance.

5. Deployment

Purpose: Release the software to production.
Activities: Installing the software in the production environment, user training, deployment scripts.
Importance: Ensures that the software is correctly installed and operational in the live environment.
