Task 2: Create a list comprehension in Python to generate squares of even numbers between 1 to 10.

answer :

# Create an empty list to store the squares of even numbers
squares_of_evens = []

# Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10
for x in range(1, 11):
    # Check if the number is even
    if x % 2 == 0:
        # If it's even, square it and add to the list
        squares_of_evens.append(x**2)

# Print the list
print("Squares of even numbers between 1 and 10:", squares_of_evens)
