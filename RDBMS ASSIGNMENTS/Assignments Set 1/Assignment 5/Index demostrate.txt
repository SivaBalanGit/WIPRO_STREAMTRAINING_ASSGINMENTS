   CREATE INDEX idx_title ON Books(title);

Faster Data Retrieval: When searching for a book by title, the database engine can use the index to quickly locate the relevant rows without having to scan the entire table.

Efficient Sorting: If you're sorting the results by title, the index allows the database engine to perform the sorting operation more efficiently.

Reduced Disk I/O: The index structure facilitates quick lookups, minimizing the number of disk I/O operations required to fetch the data.

Drop index :

   DROP INDEX idx_title ON Books;

1. Query performance may degrade, especially for queries that involve searching or sorting by the title column.

2. Data retrieval may become slower, as the database engine may need to scan the entire table to locate the relevant rows.

3. Sorting operations may require more resources and time, as the database engine cannot leverage the index for efficient sorting.
