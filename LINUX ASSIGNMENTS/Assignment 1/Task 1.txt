# Log file path
LOG_FILE="/var/log/auth.log"

ATTEMPTS_FILE="login_attempts.txt"
ERRORS_FILE="login_errors.txt"

# Use grep to filter login attempts and save to a temporary file
grep "Failed password" "$LOG_FILE" > temp_attempts.log

# Use awk to extract attempted user and error message from the temporary file
awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $9, $11}' temp_attempts.log > "$ATTEMPTS_FILE"

# Use sed to extract error message from the temporary file and save to a separate file
sed 's/.*Failed password for \(.*\) from \(.*\) port .*$/\1 - \2/' temp_attempts.log > "$ERRORS_FILE"
