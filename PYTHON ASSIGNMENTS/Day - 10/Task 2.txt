Task 2: 

Write a Python program that handles HTTP errors gracefully (e.g., 404 or 500 errors) when making API requests.

answer :-

import requests

def main():
    # URL for API request
    url = "http://example.com/api"

    try:
        # Sending GET request
        response = requests.get(url)

        # Checking if request was successful (status code 200)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Request successful!")
            # Handling response data
            print(response.json())  # Assuming JSON response
        else:
            # Handling HTTP errors gracefully
            print("Error:", response.status_code)
            if response.status_code == 404:
                print("Resource not found.")
            elif response.status_code == 500:
                print("Internal server error.")
            # Add more conditions as needed

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("Error: Failed to connect:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
