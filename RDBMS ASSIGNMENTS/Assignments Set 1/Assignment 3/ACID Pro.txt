The ACID properties are a set of four characteristics that ensure the reliability and consistency of transactions in a database system:

Atomicity: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, meaning that either all of its operations are successfully completed or none of them are. 
           There's no halfway point where some operations succeed while others fail.

Consistency: Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another. 
             This means that transactions must preserve the integrity constraints of the database; it cannot leave the database in an inconsistent state.

Isolation: Transactions should operate independently of each other. Even when multiple transactions are executing concurrently, the outcome should be the same as if they were executed serially. 
           Isolation ensures that one transaction's operations are not visible to other transactions until they are committed.

Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will not be lost, even in the event of a system failure. 
            This means that the changes made by committed transactions should persist, regardless of any subsequent failures.
