Step 1: Initialize a New Git Repository

# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my_project
cd my_project

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init


Step 2: Simulate Making Changes to the Project

# Create and add some text files
echo "This is file1.txt" > file1.txt
echo "This is file2.txt" > file2.txt

# Add the files to staging area
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added file1.txt and file2.txt"


Step 3: Create a New Branch

# Create a new branch
git branch new_branch

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout new_branch


Step 4: Make Further Changes in the New Branch

# Make changes to file1.txt
echo "Additional content in file1.txt" >> file1.txt

# Add the modified file to staging area
git add file1.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Added additional content to file1.txt"


Step 5: Merge the New Branch into the Main Branch

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the new_branch into the main branch
git merge new_branch

Step 6: Resolve Merge Conflict 

# Resolve the merge conflicts manually

# Add the resolved files to staging area
git add file1.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"


Step 7: View Git History

# View the Git log to see the commit history
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
