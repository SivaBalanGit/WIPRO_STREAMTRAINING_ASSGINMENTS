Task 2: 

Write a Python script to send a POST request with JSON data and handle the JSON response.

answer :-

import requests
import json

def main():
    # URL to which the POST request will be sent
    url = "http://example.com/api"

    # JSON data to be sent in the POST request
    json_data = {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }

    try:
        # Sending POST request with JSON data
        response = requests.post(url, json=json_data)

        # Checking if request was successful (status code 200)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Parsing JSON response
            response_data = response.json()

            # Handling response data
            print("Response received:")
            print(json.dumps(response_data, indent=4))
        else:
            print("Error: Failed to send POST request. Status code:", response.status_code)

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("Error: Failed to send POST request:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
